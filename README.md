# asuna_api
Python wrapper for asuna.ga
I am not the creator the asuna api, and some of this code came from the iDutchy some-random-api project so credits to them.
Credits to iDutchy for the orginal source.

# Getting Started:
To begin with, you'll have to install the package by doing one of the following commands:
- `pip install -U asuna_api`
- `python -m pip -U install asuna_api`

Or you can install directly from source by doing one of the following commands:
- `pip install -U git+https://github.com/JDJGInc/asuna_api`
- `python -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/JDJGInc/asuna_api`

After that, you will have to create the client:
```python
import asuna_api

client = asuna_api.Client()
```
