# asuna_api
Python wrapper for asuna.ga
I'm not the creator of asuna api, and some of the code came from the [iDutchy some-random-api project](https://github.com/iDutchy/sr_api) so credits to them.
Credits to iDutchy for the Original source and Thank You for letting me use your code.

For any questions and support for the wrapper, you can visit the [Discord support server](https://discord.gg/eVQH2ZRYpz "JDJG3493's Server") or DM me on Discord at jdjg.
